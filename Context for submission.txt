I am uploading this zip file from the lab virtual machine. Due to my laptop mistaking my HTML doc for a virus, I will submit the zip file from the 
lab environment. Any assistance in making the computer not to mistake the document for a virus is welcome. I am almost positive that submitting this 
package via the lab environment will not harm the package or solution. I have included this disclaimer nonetheless. Thank you for hopefully 
understanding, and I am sorry if this package causes problems.

(I have run the whole package (the zip file) through a virus detecttor, and it showed nothing.)

Update for further context: it seems the issue had to do with ownership certificates or the GitHub packages from committing the whole folder. As 
such the .gitignore and .gitattributes files are not included in the package. Similarly, the Visual Studio (vs) and GitHub(git) folders and content 
were not in the brand-new repository I created in hopes of correcting this misidentification of the package as malware.
